            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
               This review deals with the Tübinger System von Textverarbeitungs-Programmen
               called TUSTEP. It describes some of the principal functions of TUSTEP, outlines
               sample use cases and shows benefits and downsides. While TUSTEP is one of the
               oldest and long-lasting applications in the area of text processing, its
               flexibility and functional scope make it worth to consider for present and
               future scientific projects dealing with text edition, manipulation and
               publishing.

               <h2>General introduction</h2>
               
               <p id="p1"><span class="paracount">1</span>TUSTEP is a software toolbox or environment designed for the Digital
                  Humanities. It has been under constant development since 1966, bearing the name
                  of TUSTEP since 1978. It was located at the Zentrum für Datenverarbeitung (ZDV)
                  of the University of Tübingen until 2003 and is since then the responsibility of
                  the International TUSTEP User Group (<span class="ftn">ITUG).<sup><a href="#ftn1" class="internalref" id="fnid-ftn1">1</a></sup></span>
                  
               </p>
               
               <p id="p2"><span class="paracount">2</span>The program authors, Wilhelm Ott and Kuno Schälkle, still update and
                  develop the program, issuing a new version approximately each year. TUSTEP 2018
                  is the latest stable version for production at the moment.
               </p>
               
               <p id="p3"><span class="paracount">3</span>This version and older versions may be downloaded, installed and used
                  for free. They are compatible with Windows, Linux and Mac operating systems and
                  I found the installation to be <span class="ftn">straightforward.<sup><a href="#ftn2" class="internalref" id="fnid-ftn2">2</a></sup></span> This review is based upon the Windows <span class="ftn">version.<sup><a href="#ftn3" class="internalref" id="fnid-ftn3">3</a></sup></span> On Windows, it is sufficient to open
                  the installation file and choose a folder for installation. It is recommended to
                  additionally install GhostScript and/or GhostView<sup><a href="#ftn4" class="internalref" id="fnid-ftn4">4</a></sup>
                  because Windows and TUSTEP do not have a native support for Postscript-files
                  (.ps) and these are mandatory when it comes to typesetting. For MAC and Linux,
                  this step is usually not necessary.
               </p>
               
               <p id="p4"><span class="paracount">4</span>While TUSTEP is normally installed on a personal computer, it is also
                  possible to run it on a Linux Server and there have even been successful
                  experiments to run the software on Raspberry <span class="ftn">Pis.<sup><a href="#ftn5" class="internalref" id="fnid-ftn5">5</a></sup></span>

               </p>
               
               <p id="p5"><span class="paracount">5</span>Being a software toolbox, TUSTEP does not have a single purpose,
                  functionality or area of application ‒ except that it is designed to work with
                  texts. As will be explained in more detail in the next section, TUSTEP consists
                  of a variety of modules, each of which being designed for its specific task.
                  Those modules can be combined almost freely by the user to create very complex
                  workflows, so that the program suits the users’ individual needs. With regard to
                  digital scholarly editions, TUSTEP supports all steps of a typical editorial
                  workflow: From transcription to collation, from the constitution of critical
                  texts with up to nine apparatus levels to the creation of indices and
                  concordances, from professional typesetting to converting a text into any
                  desired plain text file format.

               <h2>What is TUSTEP capable of</h2>
               
               <p id="p6"><span class="paracount">6</span>As said above, TUSTEP consists of individual modules also referred to
                  as commands. There are currently 54 commands in TUSTEP. Each has a German and an
                  alternative English alias that consists of a leading "#", the command name and a
                  variable number of parameters. For example, there is a command for copying the
                  contents of one file into another. The name of this command is
                  <span class="code">#KOPIERE</span> (or <span class="code">#COPY</span> in English). As shown below, it
                  has a few comma separated parameters: "quelle" (source) and "ziel" (destination)
                  ask for filenames, "modus" (mode) and "loeschen" (delete) ask in a short
                  notation ("+" for yes, "-" for no) whether the line numbers of the file should
                  be recounted or the destination file overwritten: 
               </p>
               <p class="code-example" id="code1">
                  <span class="code">
                     <br>#KOPIERE, <br>quelle = file_a, <br>ziel = file_b, <br>modus = +,
                     <br>loeschen = + </span>
                  <span class="code-caption">Code 1</span>
                  
               </p>
               
               <p id="p7"><span class="paracount">7</span>The order of the parameters can be altered if one wishes to, but
                  there is a standard order. TUSTEP comes with a command-line based user interface
                  which is described in more detail below. The user tells TUSTEP the commands to
                  be executed by typing them into the command line. In order to save a lot of
                  typing, any command may be abbreviated after the second letter at the latest and
                  all parameters names may be omitted if the standard order is observed. The above
                  command may also look like this: 
               </p>
               <p class="code-example" id="code2">
                  <span class="code">
                     <br>#KO, file_a, file_b, +, + </span>
                  <span class="code-caption">Code 2</span>
                  
               </p>
               
               <p id="p8"><span class="paracount">8</span>Both notations do the same thing: Copy the contents of "file_a" into
                  "file_b", recount the line numbers and overwrite the former contents of
                  "file_b". It is possible to combine the short hand notation with the full
                  notation.
               </p>
               
               <p id="p9"><span class="paracount">9</span>One benefit of TUSTEP lies in the extensive functionality of its
                  commands. While copying a file, the user may simultaneously want to manipulate
                  the contents of that file. Let’s suppose, there is a certain XML or SGML tagset
                  in "file_a" that should be converted to TEI-XML. The command accepts additional
                  parameters (here between "*" and "*eof" ‒ eof standing for "end of file"):
                  
               </p>
               <p class="code-example" id="code3">
                  <span class="code">
                     <br>#KOPIERE, file_a, file_b, +, +, parameter = * <br>XX
                     |&lt;Name&gt;|&lt;persName&gt;| <br>XX
                     |&lt;/Name&gt;|&lt;/persName&gt;| <br>*eof </span>
                  <span class="code-caption">Code 3</span>
                  
               </p>
               
               <p id="p10"><span class="paracount">10</span>The parameter "XX" exchanges strings with other strings. It also
                  accepts string patterns, so it is possible to compress these two lines of
                  parameters into one by making the backslash <span class="ftn">optional.<sup><a href="#ftn6" class="internalref" id="fnid-ftn6">6</a></sup></span> But this is not the only
                  possible parameter. There are dozens for <span class="code">#KOPIERE</span> that can be
                  combined. One of them, for example, selects only lines in a file which meet
                  certain criteria (e. g. contain a specific string), exchanges some parts of that
                  string, adds consecutive numbers at the beginning of the line and introduces
                  some tags. By this procedure, it would be easy to search for strings in a text
                  and give all search results back as a numbered result set in XML, HTML or any
                  other text format ‒ perhaps you need a comma separated list to use in Excel or
                  to import into a SQL-Database? That would be no problem.
               </p>
               
               <p id="p11"><span class="paracount">11</span>Aside from <span class="code">#KOPIERE</span>, TUSTEP contains a variety of
                  commands for editing a text (<span class="code">#EDIERE</span>), indexing a text
                  (<span class="code">#RVORBREITE</span> ‒ prepare a registry by breaking down the texts
                  into tokens, <span class="code">#SORTIERE</span> ‒ sort the tokens by any alphabetical or
                  numerical order and <span class="code">#RAUFBEREITE</span> ‒ sum up the tokens into the
                  registry entries with or without references), comparing two or more texts with
                  each other (<span class="code">#VERGLEICHE</span> and <span class="code">#VAUFBEREITE</span>) or typeset a
                  text (<span class="code">#SATZ</span>). In digital scholarly editions, these are all very
                  important features. Some of them will be discussed here below. 
               </p>
               
               <p id="p12"><span class="paracount">12</span>
                  <span class="code">#EDIERE</span> opens a text editor in which the user can edit a text file
                  with up to 2 Gigabyte size. TUSTEP opens a file of this size in the same amount
                  of time as a file of one kilobyte. While editors in office suits (Microsoft
                  Word, Libre Office Writer etc.) and many programming editors (like Notepad++,
                  Oxygen XML Editor) load the whole file at once, TUSTEP only loads as many lines
                  as fit on the screen. The user can navigate "screen by screen" or jump to any
                  particular part of that file without losing much time on scrolling or buffering
                  the whole file. The editor comes with a pattern matching syntax (similar to
                  regular expressions) in order to search for inflection forms or suffixes. It
                  supports individual shortcuts, syntax highlighting and has the ability to
                  perform user defined macros.
               </p>
               
               <p id="p13"><span class="paracount">13</span>
                  <span class="code">#VERGLEICHE</span> can perform a comparison of multiple texts, as many as
                  the user wants, by comparing each text with a base text.
                  <span class="code">#VAUFBEREITE</span> generates a formatted list of the differences
                  between these texts. These two commands can be used for collating text
                  witnesses, or to compare the changes made in previous working sessions ‒ which
                  is very useful when it comes to correcting. By adding parameters, it is possible
                  to specify for every single comparison what is considered to be important or
                  unimportant.
               </p>
               
               <p id="p14"><span class="paracount">14</span>Automatically creating indices with <span class="code">#RVORBEREITE</span>,
                  <span class="code">#SORTIERE</span> and <span class="code">#RAUFBEREITE</span> is important for
                  checking an edited text in search of errors or to create registers of persons
                  and places. The fact that the creation of indices is broken down into three
                  separate steps makes it very flexible. In every step, parameters can be added
                  that, for instance, control which parts of a text are indexed, how the word
                  forms are sorted and how they are summarized.
               </p>
               
               <p id="p15"><span class="paracount">15</span>Finally, one of the most important features in TUSTEP is
                  <span class="code">#SATZ</span>, which enables to professionally typeset texts with or
                  without footnotes, critical apparatus, illustrations, and thus prepare them for
                  publication. In a review, it would be impossible to give a comprehensive
                  description of this module alone, but at least I want to give an impression of
                  its features. In the TUSTEP handbook, over 200 pages are dedicated to describe
                  the functional scope of <span class="code">#SATZ</span>, which includes native support for
                  many alphabets like Latin, Greek, Coptic, Hebrew, Arabian or Russian, and give,
                  for instance, the possibility to place any arbitrary superscript or subscript
                  letter over or under another <span class="ftn">one.<sup><a href="#ftn7" class="internalref" id="fnid-ftn7">7</a></sup></span>
                  
               </p>
               
               <p id="p16"><span class="paracount">16</span>While it is nice to have a separate command for each purpose,
                  research projects and especially editorial enterprises need more complex
                  workflows, in which many steps have to be executed successively. So it would be
                  very uncomfortable to type in the commands every time. In TUSTEP, the user can
                  therefore create her/his own workflows by writing the commands needed into a
                  temporary or permanent file and execute this file over and over again. This
                  gives the ability to the user to create a customized program. It is also
                  possible to execute such a file with variables to adapt the program at each
                  execution. The user may furthermore save the interim results or create protocols
                  for every step to analyze them later. A sample program may look like this (I
                  have omitted all specifications just to show the concept). My comments are
                  behind the two slashes:
               </p>
               
               <p class="code-example" id="code4">
                  <span class="code"> #UMWANDLE, ... // Import an .xml-file into a TUSTEP file <br>#KOPIERE,
                     ... // Copy the text of this file into another one while manipulating it
                     <br>#SATZ, ... // Typeset the manipulated text, in order to have page
                     and line numbers <br>#RVORBEREITE, ... // Break down the formatted text
                     into tokens <br>#SORTIERE, ... // Sort the tokens <br>#RAUFBEREITE,
                     ... // Create a register with the page and line numbers from #SATZ
                     <br>#KOPIERE, ... // Copy the register underneath the text <br>#SATZ,
                     ... // Typeset text and register together <br>#*PSAUS, ... // Output

                     HTML-tags for digital publication <br>#DATEI, ... // Create a new file,

                     HTML-tags into this file </span>
                  <span class="code-caption">Code 4</span>
                  
               </p> 
               <p id="p17"><span class="paracount">17</span> TUSTEP is also equipped with a modern scripting language called
                  TUSCRIPT. After writing TUSTEP-commands into a file, it is possible to control
                  the workflow with structures from TUSCRIPT, like if-then-queries, loops and a
                  variety of predefined functions. The scripting language allows to largely
                  automatize the workflows.
               </p>
               
               <p id="p18"><span class="paracount">18</span>But what is more important: TUSTEP gives to the user the possibility
                  to create new and more complex tools (i. e. new programs) out of the pieces of
                  software in the toolbox. Hence the true power of TUSTEP does not lie in the
                  functionality of its single components, but in their flexibility and the
                  possibility to combine them as needed to find customized solutions for specific
                  and new problems. It is a major feature of TUSTEP that the user is able to
                  import and export their data or edition materials at any time from and into any
                  plain text format with any desired markup (for example custom XML or TEI-XML).
                  Hence, the results of a TUSTEP based workflow can be processed further in other
                  applications, and vice versa results from other applications can be processed
                  with TUSTEP.

               <p id="p19"><span class="paracount">19</span> While many applications work with a specific markup, for example
                  XML-tags, TUSTEP does not need a fixed markup, except when it comes to
                  typesetting. When typesetting a text with <span class="code">#SATZ</span>, the typesetting
                  engine needs specific control instructions. But the user can tell
                  <span class="code">#SATZ</span> which elements of the markup should be converted into
                  which control instructions.

               <figure id="img1">

               <p id="p20"><span class="paracount">20</span>
                   When starting the program for the first time, the screen leads the
                  user to a menu (see <a href="#img1" class="crossref">Fig. 1</a>) for
                  creating a "Sitzung" (session). A session ‒ one may think of as the project’s
                  default directory or root directory on the user hard drive ‒ is a security
                  concept and one that forces to keep order in the files. All files of a project
                  have to be in this directory (or in sub-directories) to enable access to a
                  TUSTEP <span class="ftn">session.<sup><a href="#ftn8" class="internalref" id="fnid-ftn8">8</a></sup></span> A session stores much
                  information about actions in temporal files (for example the last commands
                  typed, the last files opened, the individual shortcuts chosen for this
                  particular project) ‒ but it will never send this or any other information
                  automatically over the <span class="ftn">internet.<sup><a href="#ftn9" class="internalref" id="fnid-ftn9">9</a></sup></span> Thus it
                  is not only recommended but safe to create a session for each project one is
                  working on. With the creation of a session, it is also possible create a desktop
                  icon, that would start that particular session.
               </p>

               <p id="p21"><span class="paracount">21</span>
                   Once TUSTEP is open with a session, the starting screen (see <a href="#img2" class="crossref">Fig. 2</a>) pops up showing the command
                  line at the bottom where the user can enter commands directly. In the blue field
                  above, TUSTEP gives information about the program version and feedback on the
                  commands entered. This includes error messages and notifications of success.
               </p>

               <p id="p22"><span class="paracount">22</span>
                   If the user types the command <span class="code">#EDIERE</span> (or <span class="code">#e</span>
                  in short) into the command line and hits enter, the TUSTEP editor opens an empty
                  file. The editor screen has three main parts (as shown in <a href="#img3" class="crossref">Fig. 3</a>): A field for the line numbers on the left, a
                  text field on the right and a command line at the bottom. While in many editors
                  (like Oxygen XML editor or Notepad++) line numbers are just for display and are
                  not an essential part of the file itself, TUSTEP’s own file format saves the
                  line numbers inside the file. That is why it is necessary to import .xml or .txt
                  or .rtf files into TUSTEP by converting them into the TUSTEP file format and
                  exporting TUSTEP files back to other file formats: This adds (or eliminates) the
                  line numbers which guarantee fast access to the file (as mentioned in the above
                  section) and enable TUSTEP to load a reduced number of lines.

               <p id="p23"><span class="paracount">23</span>The line numbers can also be used to imitate simple text structures.
                  Three levels of line numbers are accepted, such as 200.098/54. This number can
                  be interpreted as page number 200 and line number 98 referring to a printed
                  book, with a third additional number for editorial additions like apparatus
                  entries or notes on the text of the line.

                   It is also possible to have a text collection in one file, for example
                  all novels written by Jules Verne, which are differentiated by the first number.
                  In this way, the user would have easy access to each novel whilst having the
                  possibility to search and edit all novels at once. <a href="#img4" class="crossref">Fig. 4</a> shows the beginning of Jules Verne’s <em>Reise
                     zum Mittelpunkt der Erde</em> which is in this collection the 51st text,
                  having line numbers beginning with the number 51. An information window showing
                  the number of sentences in the file, among other information, is available. All
                  novels by Jules Verne consume about 80 MB of hard drive space.

               <h2>What are the downsides of TUSTEP</h2>
               
               <p id="p25"><span class="paracount">25</span>Since the software originally dates from the 1960s and the 1970s
                  where mouse and touch screen were not common or even invented and screens had
                  little resolution, TUSTEP has a concept of usage that is not very intuitive to
                  those who got to know modern graphical user interfaces first. It takes some time
                  to get used to the TUSTEP way of using a computer program. The method of
                  entering commands, via command-line and not having drop-down menus, is in itself
                  useful – I believe one could enter commands faster using the keyboard instead of
                  using a mouse –, but it forces the users to rethink their habits to operate an
                  application.
               </p>
               
               <p id="p26"><span class="paracount">26</span>As TUSTEP is a professional tool with numerous functionalities, it
                  is not easy to use. The learning curve is quite steep at the beginning: Some
                  weeks or even months are needed until working with TUSTEP takes up speed and one
                  becomes familiar with all important functions. Furthermore, the technology used
                  is TUSTEP-specific, thus the skills aquired cannot be reused in a different
                  environment, unlike standards such as XQuery or XPath. On the other hand, within
                  TUSTEP, once the user has learnt enough s/he can apply her or his knowledge to
                  many projects, saving time. Also, with the skills to create, edit, analyze and
                  typeset texts, one becomes less dependent on the skills of other persons.
               </p>
               
               <p id="p27"><span class="paracount">27</span>Another downside is that there are some peculiarities in TUSTEP. For
                  example, file names may be only up to 12 characters long (plus up to four
                  characters in the file extension). If the user wants to use longer file names,
                  s/he has to either rename the files or use a workaround by defining the longer
                  file names as variables known to the session, in order to use the variable names
                  instead of the file names. This and other peculiarities are part of the
                  inheritance of the program’s long history, which makes them understandable: but
                  perhaps it is time to rethink these parts of TUSTEP for the future.

               <p id="p28"><span class="paracount">28</span>Due to the complexity of TUSTEP, it is recommended that beginners
                  take an introductory course. The ITUG homepage informs about courses held at
                  different universities in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. There is also the
                  possibility to take a course within the scope of the annual ITUG conference.
               </p>
               
               <p id="p29"><span class="paracount">29</span>Apart from that, there is a TUSTEP wiki<sup><a href="#ftn10" class="internalref" id="fnid-ftn10">10</a></sup>
                  where beginners and advanced users find tutorials, help for troubleshooting and
                  a series of sample programs for common problems. This is a good starting point,
                  but if the tips in the wiki are insufficient to help you out, one can ask
                  questions on the TUSTEP mailing <span class="ftn">list.<sup><a href="#ftn11" class="internalref" id="fnid-ftn11">11</a></sup></span>
                  In my experience, answers arrive within 24 hours and they normally solve the
                  problem directly or give enough hints to find a solution. Although the TUSTEP
                  community is quite small in comparison to other users software communities, I
                  find it to be helpful, friendly and understanding; even the program authors will
                  respond, particularly if the problem might indicate a bug.
               </p>
               
               <p id="p30"><span class="paracount">30</span>As mentioned before, there is a handbook coming with each version of
                  TUSTEP lying in the installation folder. The handbook offers a complete
                  description of TUSTEP’s features, but its terminology is quite abstract and it
                  takes some time to get used to it. The time is not wasted though, because it
                  gives an exhaustive overview of the functionalities and the parameters.
                  Unfortunately, there is no up-to-date introduction in the form of a
                  <span class="ftn">monograph.<sup><a href="#ftn12" class="internalref" id="fnid-ftn12">12</a></sup></span>

               <p id="p31"><span class="paracount">31</span>Now, who uses TUSTEP? Over the decades many editorial projects have
                  relied on the program. A list of ongoing and finished projects is available on
                  the ITUG <span class="ftn">homepage;<sup><a href="#ftn13" class="internalref" id="fnid-ftn13">13</a></sup></span>
                  while this list is by far not comprehensive, it gives an impression of the
                  variety of scientific contexts TUSTEP is used in.

               <h2>Conclusion</h2>
               
               <p id="p32"><span class="paracount">32</span>TUSTEP is one of the oldest programs still in use in the Digital
                  Humanities: it proves that software can survive more than just one decade. Many
                  programs have come and gone in the time TUSTEP is around. Especially in the last
                  few years so much software in the Digital Humanities has been developed and is
                  in part already forgotten, because a new standard was introduced making the
                  software obsolete, or a new version of an operating system was published and the
                  software could not be run anymore, or a newer software was more powerful, so
                  users had no need to use the older software.
               </p>
               
               <p id="p33"><span class="paracount">33</span>The fact that TUSTEP has survived since the 1960s may be an
                  indication that the software is still powerful and competitive, and that it
                  successfully runs on different platforms. Indeed, TUSTEP files from the past on
                  a magnetic tape would still be readable by TUSTEP 2018 ‒ provided that you had a
                  device that could still read a magnetic tape. So one may state that TUSTEP
                  itself is sustainable and the developers have always tried to make the
                  application compatible from one version to another.
               </p>
               
               <p id="p34"><span class="paracount">34</span>Even though some parts of TUSTEP have aged and could be renewed in
                  the future, like the built-in text editor (that is one of 54 commands), in my
                  opinion TUSTEP is worth being considered in new scientific projects dealing with
                  texts or text editions. Because of the possibility to easily convert from and
                  into different file formats, TUSTEP can also be used in combination with other
                  software in a complementary and modular manner.

               replacement for refactoring XML would only work if the XML file has a
               regular content, something which is not imposed by the XML syntax: one may
               thing for instance of extra whitespaces or changes in the order of the
               attributes, which would cause mismatches.

               possibility to create a remote session, where the files are stored on a
               server that all developers of a project have access to. TUSTEP sessions
               avoid maintenance issues by ensuring that only one session at a time can
               have writing access to a single file.

               example Microsoft Office or the Atom editor) send by default usage
               statistics, crash reports or other metrics (often referred to as diagnostic
               data) over the internet unless a user explicitly deactivates this
               functionality. In this review, of course, there is no room to discuss the
               pros and cons of programs sending usage information to their developers.
               Anyway, TUSTEP does not have a function to collect user data.
