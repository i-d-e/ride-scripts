               <em>Digital Thoreau</em> is a web resource comprising three digital projects
               related to the work of Henry David Thoreau created at SUNY Geneseo. The first of
               these is a fluid text edition of Thoreau’s most famous work <em>Walden</em>. This
               allows multiple versions of the text to be represented simultaneously in a dynamic
               environment, which can be a valuable resource to Thoreau scholars, particularly for
               those interested in researching the genetic aspect of the text. In the second project
               a very innovative and engaging social reading platform has been created in order to
               facilitate community and student driven annotation of both <em>Walden</em> and
               his 1849 essay <em>Resistance to Civil Government</em>. The third project is a
               student created digital archive of the papers of Thoreau scholar Walter Harding,
               which is primarily a pedagogical exercise in digital humanities for the students of
               SUNY Geneseo. <em>Digital Thoreau</em> as a whole is a multi-faceted web resource
               that offers interesting new opportunities for scholarly research as well as for
               teaching and public engagement with Thoreau’s influential works.

               <p id="p1"><span class="paracount">1</span>
                  <em>Walden</em>, first published in 1854, is perhaps the best-known work of the
                  nineteenth century American writer, philosopher, civil activist and abolitionist
                  Henry David Thoreau. The work was Thoreau’s memoir of more than two years spent
                  living in a cabin in the woods near Walden Pond in Concord, Massachusetts from 1845
                  to 1847. Thoreau’s attempt to step away from contemporary society and live a simple
                  and deliberate life in a one-room structure continues to resonate to this day as a
                  symbol of individualism and anti-establishment civil disobedience.

                  <em> Digital Thoreau</em>, published by SUNY Geneseo, aims to build a resource
                  and a community dedicated to promoting the deliberate reading of Thoreau's works in
                  new ways, ways that take advantage of technology to illuminate Thoreau's creative
                  process and facilitate thoughtful conversation about his words and ideas’ (Schacht
                  2014a, homepage) It has been quite successful in achieving this goal and stands as
                  an
                  excellent example of a digital scholarly edition that is useful for scholarly and
                  pedagogical purposes while also being enjoyable to engage with. In its presentation
                  of <em>Walden</em> it provides a fluid text edition of seven variants of the
                  publication and also a separate social reading edition of the book. Both of these
                  digital representations of <em>Walden</em>, in my opinion, qualify as digital
                  scholarly editions. They are both critical representations of a text that adhere to
                  digital paradigms. The former is a fluid text variorum and the latter a digital
                  edition of a text with social annotations, neither of these two outcomes could be
                  realistically achieved in print form. <em>Digital Thoreau</em> also contains a
                  third ‘project’ that will be discussed briefly in this review, which is essentially
                  an exhibition of manuscripts of Walter Harding, a prominent scholar of the writer
                  in
                  question. The focus of this review will thus be primarily on an analysis of the fluid
                  text edition and the reader’s edition presented by <em>Digital Thoreau</em>. Each
                  of the projects will first be assessed in isolation before later reflecting on the
                  resource as a whole.

               <div>
                  
                  <h3>Aims and Objectives</h3>
                  
                  <p id="p3"><span class="paracount">3</span>The foundation stone of this genetic representation of the text is the
                     scholarship carried out by Ronald E. Clapper in his 1967 dissertation in which he
                     created a critical apparatus of the <em>Walden</em> manuscript HM924 at the
                     Huntington Library. This built on earlier scholarship conducted by H.M. Shanley
                     and the hypothesis that this particular manuscript was evidence that
                     <em>Walden</em> was created in seven distinct phases, thus represented in
                     Clapper’s critical apparatus. In this review I will not attempt to assess the
                     scholarship carried out by Clapper and Shanley but rather to consider the merits
                     and realization of the scholarship in the chosen digital representation as a fluid
                     text. The selection of Clapper’s representation of <em>Walden</em> is both a
                     practical choice and a very wise decision. Since Clapper’s dissertation is already
                     considered to be indispensible for Thoreau researchers it makes sense to build
                     upon the foundations of this well-established scholarship and attempt to see if
                     representing it in a new form can create space for new scholarly discussions and
                     conclusions on the text.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p id="p4"><span class="paracount">4</span>By taking the critical apparatus from Clapper’s dissertation used to
                     indicate variants and then encoding it in TEI XML the team at Digital Thoreau have
                     enabled the representation and display of the seven proposed variants of the text
                     using the <em>Versioning Machine</em>. The 1971 print edition of
                     <em>Walden</em> edited by Shanley is then used as a base edition to which
                     variants can be compared, in reality leaving the user with eight texts for
                     comparison. Conceptually this appears to have been a resounding success; users can
                     select any combination of one or all variants to read on screen beside each other
                     inside the Versioning Machine interface.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p id="p5"><span class="paracount">5</span>The edition intends to adhere to John Bryant’s principles concerning
                     fluid text which he laid out in 2002 in his book <em>The Fluid Text: A Theory of
                        Revision and Editing for Book and Screen</em>: 
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                     Simply put, a fluid text is any literary work that exists in more than
                     one version. It is ‘fluid’ because the versions flow from one to another.
                     Truth be told, all works – because of the nature of texts and creativity –
                     are fluid texts. Not only is this fluidity the inherent condition of any
                     written document; it is inherent in the phenomenon of writing itself. That
                     is, writing is fundamentally an arbitrary hence unstable approximation of
                     thought. Moreover, we revise words to make them more closely approximate our
                     thoughts, which in turn evolve as we write. And this condition and
                     phenomenon of textual fluidity is not a theoretical supposition; it is
                     fact.

                  <p id="p6"><span class="paracount">6</span>Bryant applied his fluid text principles in the creation of the
                     digital edition of Herman Melville’s 1846 book <em>Typee</em> (Bryant 2006).
                     This allows users to view two simultaneous views of a variety of combinations of
                     manuscript, print and diplomatic transcriptions of the work. This works well for
                     that particular project although the layout of two versions displayed one above
                     another would not work for <em>Digital Thoreau</em>, which can show eight
                     versions simultaneously in separate vertical columns. The <em>Typee</em>
                     edition also presents quite comprehensive information on the editorial principles
                     of editing this fluid text as well as insights into the work itself and the
                     process of how it was written and revised. However, this form of editorial
                     information is currently absent from <em>Digital Thoreau</em>. At present,
                     there is rather limited information to explain and justify its editorial concepts
                     and also any editorial decisions that were taken during the creation of the
                     edition. Ideally such an essay would need to provide further information on the
                     selection of Clapper’s dissertation, the decision to use the 1971 edition as its
                     base text, to provide some basic introduction to the principles of ‘fluid text’,
                     some information regarding decisions made in encoding of the text and perhaps some
                     information regarding choices of particular digital tools and software over any
                     alternatives. Paul Schacht is aware of this matter and has indicated to me that
                     there is a plan to provide a full editorial introduction to the edition that will
                     clarify these editorial principles and objectives in the near future. Users of the
                     edition might further benefit if the editors took this one step further by
                     including specific ‘revision narratives’, which are an additional aspect of
                     Bryant’s fluid text model. Revision narratives are intended to provide
                     individualised informative narratives of each site of revision of the text and
                     serve as a direct means of contact between the editors and the readers of a fluid
                     text (Bryant 2002, 159-160). Another planned additional feature for <em>Digital
                        Thoreau</em> will be the inclusion of facsimiles of manuscripts for
                     comparison with the genetic text; this has the potential to be a great enhancement
                     if integrated well in the edition. Furthermore, they hope to incorporate comment
                     and annotation features into this environment that may enhance user engagement and
                     interaction.

                  <p id="p7"><span class="paracount">7</span>Can it be considered to be a genetic edition of <em>Thoreau</em>?
                     There are multiple definitions that can be drawn upon to help establish this.
                     Looking at the three English language definitions of ‘genetic edition’ in the <em>
                        <a href="http://uahost.uantwerpen.be/lse/index.php/lexicon/genetic-edition/" class="text-link">Lexicon of Scholarly Editing</a>
                        </em> I believe the answer is yes. It certainly meets the requirements of
                     Kline’s definition when she states that a genetic-text edition is a ‘textual
                     edition that tries to offer the reader access to more than one level of textual
                     creation within a single page’ – or in this case within a single screen. Bryant’s
                     own definition from his <em>Fluid Text</em> publication is also clearly
                     applicable as it stands as an edition ‘which integrates coded, sequentialized
                     variants into the reading text.’ The final and strictest definition comes from
                     Grésillon via Van Hulle, that it ‘should contain the reproduction of all the
                     genetic documents, bibliographical descriptions, and an introduction regarding the
                     location of the manuscript and the general history of its genesis, comprising
                     letters and other relevant evidence.’ The project does not meet the requirements
                     of this particular definition of genetic criticism as these features are clearly
                     absent. That is not to say that this particular representation of multiple
                     variants on a single screen has no value for genetic critics, in fact I believe
                     quite the opposite is true. This digital representation should be a very useful
                     environment for scholars to develop hypotheses relating to the writing process and
                     other related research questions which they could investigate in further detail
                     elsewhere using additional materials. As Shillingsburg and Van Hulle argue digital
                     environments are ideal for genetic research: ‘Whereas, in scholarly editing,
                     manuscript analysis is often seen as a means to an end, that is, a tool to make an
                     edition, genetic criticism reverses these roles and sees the making of an edition
                     as a tool to facilitate manuscript analysis’ (Shillingsburg and Van Hulle 2015,
                     36). The very fact that the text used for these variants are based on witnesses
                     hypothesised by Clapper also allows the opportunity to perform further research to
                     confirm or disconfirm the various passages and witnesses which his piece of
                     scholarship presented.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p id="p8"><span class="paracount">8</span>The Fluid Text Edition of <em>Walden</em> can still be considered
                     to be a work-in-progress. Nonetheless, the absence of an editorial essay even at
                     this stage of the edition’s development stands as the crucial shortcoming of
                     <em>Digital Thoreau</em> as a scholarly resource. This does not impact
                     greatly on the usability of the edition as a tool but it does detract
                     significantly from its scholarly credibility. For users who are not specialist
                     scholars of Thoreau, little information is provided regarding the scholarship that
                     led to the hypothesis that the HM924 manuscript is evidence of the work being
                     drafted in seven distinct phases for example. Such a user is left to either take
                     this hypothesis for granted or to seek out original scholarship elsewhere.

                  <p id="p9"><span class="paracount">9</span>The Versioning Machine was developed by Susan Schreibman whilst
                     working at the Maryland Institute, first released in 2002 and this version dates
                     to 2010. The purpose of the software is to allow multiple variants of a TEI
                     encoded text to be compared on screen side by side. The creators of <em>Digital
                        Thoreau</em> have not indicated why they chose the Versioning Machine over
                     other alternatives such as CollateX. The advantage of using CollateX, for example,
                     is its extensive documentation on the collation algorithms employed and the
                     possibility to modify them. CollateX, however, requires a much higher level of
                     technical skill to install and operate. Perhaps the Versioning Machine may have
                     been chosen because it is relatively user-friendly. Schreibman herself has
                     described the Versioning Machine as ‘a piece of software in a box designed for
                     non-programmers’ (Hansen 2013). The construction of the edition is also in some
                     ways used as a pedagogical exercise for students of SUNY who have been and
                     continue to be involved in the creation of the edition and perhaps due to this it
                     made sense to utilise more out-of-the-box software options (cf. Hucalak and
                     Richardson 2013).

                  <p id="p10"><span class="paracount">10</span>The Versioning Machine by design does not require users to choose a
                     base version of the text but can potentially compare any version of the text with
                     any other. In this case the print edition by Shanley has been selected as a base
                     text to which all seven variants of the manuscript text are compared. The column
                     displaying the base edition can be closed allowing you to view two or more
                     manuscript versions simultaneously, although the comparative visualisation still
                     relates to the base version. A column containing bibliographic information appears
                     on the left that can be toggled off to make space, as can an optional column of
                     notes on the right-hand side. Columns can be scrolled independently of each other;
                     this allows the user to read different parts of the text at the same time. A
                     slightly frustrating issue with the software is that when navigating between
                     different chapters the view returns to displaying the two default versions rather
                     than retaining the combination of versions you had chosen to display. There is
                     functionality provided for reporting issues – built into the bibliographic
                     information panel – but this was not working at the time of review. The variations
                     in text between versions are clearly indicated using a simple but effective font
                     colour scheme indicated in the bibliographic information column on the left, which
                     indicate unchanged text, changes in text, interpolations, interlineations and
                     strikethroughs.

                      The Versioning Machine fluid text interface in <em>Digital
                        Thoreau</em> perhaps leaves a little to be desired regarding its visual
                     appearance as it appears quite dated in terms of design. However, it is extremely
                     functional and very easy to use which in many ways makes up for any aesthetic
                     shortcomings. In my opinion the software is quite user-friendly and intuitive, all
                     of its functionality was clear to me after just a few short moments due to the
                     simplicity of its layout. Despite this clarity the project team have also kindly
                     provided a user guide for this particular edition. The project team have indicated
                     that improvements are planned for customising this interface design in the future.
                     At present the user is confronted with the standard Versioning Machine web
                     interface that provides no navigation back to the general <em>Digital
                        Thoreau</em> site but rather stands in isolation. The Versioning Machine
                     software also allows for inclusion of facsimile images, which are displayed as a
                     popup window that can be clicked on each column. However, this is a rather clunky
                     design and would not be the best way to present the manuscript facsimiles when
                     they are ready for inclusion. A customised interface that allows for the display
                     of both texts and facsimiles simultaneously in separate columns would be better as
                     would a responsive design that allows it to adapt to smaller screen sizes such as
                     tablets. A recent blog post on the site has indicated that they are busy working
                     on such an improved interface and also that they will make the interface more
                     accessible on tablet screens ‘for scholars who want to read Thoreau in the library
                     and woods alike’ (Schacht 2014b, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160608091603/http://digitalthoreau.org/life-in-the-digital-woods-walden-a-fluid-text-updated/" class="text-link">Life in the Digital Woods</a>) – an improvement which would likely be much
                     appreciated by many users.

                  <p id="p12"><span class="paracount">12</span>The TEI XML files are made available for the user to download as a
                     compressed zip or tar file. The TEI encoding of the text was conducted to some
                     extent by students of SUNY Geneseo, although it is unclear to what extent scholars
                     may have been involved in the process of encoding or training the students and
                     checking their output. A recent upgrade of the edition has also made the XSLT
                     source code available in the same way. In this upgrade the project team state that
                     they have cleaned up various textual errors and bugs reported by users. It also
                     includes the addition of a very useful ‘Data Dictionary’ which provides a list and
                     definitions of the TEI elements and attributes employed in encoding the text,
                     aimed at both beginners and advanced users of TEI (Schacht 2014a, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160608092026/http://www.digitalthoreau.org/walden/fluid/dict/" class="text-link">Data Dictionary for Walden</a>). Finally, the students at Geneseo have
                     encoded Thoreau’s own journal annotations regarding the text and plugged them into
                     the Versioning Machine as notes, which adds another interesting dimension to allow
                     users to study the genesis of the text.

                  <h3>Overview</h3>
                  
                  <p id="p13"><span class="paracount">13</span>Readers’ Thoreau forms the second ‘project’ within the <em>Digital
                        Thoreau</em> website. It aims to present both a digital reading edition of
                     the <em>Walden</em> text and to create an online community of engaged users.
                     They have chosen to use the text of the first print edition of <em>Walden</em>
                     from 1854 as the reading edition and integrated collaborative annotation
                     functionality. This includes annotations from Walter Harding, who as mentioned
                     already was a prominent Thoreau scholar and the subject of the third ‘project’
                     within <em>Digital Thoreau</em>. This format creates an interesting discourse,
                     whereby annotations from the 1960s sit alongside comments from current users –
                     gathering different generations of scholarship together in one place, as if in
                     conversation with each other. More recently the editors have added a second text,
                     that being Thoreau’s other well-known work <em>Resistance to Civil
                        Government</em>. They have included it in its original form as an essay
                     published in an anthology called <em>Aesthetic Papers</em> in 1849. This more
                     recent addition does not presently display any annotations from earlier
                     scholarship as they have done with the <em>Walden text</em>.

                      Within the Readers’ Thoreau project there are two separate interfaces
                     deriving from two plugins utilised in this WordPress website. The landing pages
                     and community forums are presented as Commons in a Box interfaces and the reading
                     edition has been built using the CommentPress plugin. The usage of this
                     combination of tools is quite sensible – although the different interfaces yet
                     again make the overall resource slightly fragmented. Hopefully plans to update the
                     design across <em>Digital Thoreau</em> will also improve the integration of
                     these interfaces.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p id="p15"><span class="paracount">15</span>CommentPress is an open source theme and plugin for WordPress that
                     was developed by a think tank called The Institute for the Future of the Book. One
                     advantage of using the WordPress theme is its responsive design; it works well on
                     both tablet and mobile devices. The only hindrance to this is that the user must
                     navigate through the landing pages of Readers’ Thoreau which, although responsive,
                     make it a little unclear how to navigate to the reading text. Tablets are highly
                     social devices; industry statistics show that the use of social media is the
                     second only to gaming on mobile/tablet devices in terms of time spent per app
                     (Bosomworth 2015). Thus, they are potentially an excellent platform for social
                     reading activities. Paul Schacht seems to have made an earlier attempt at this
                     type of social edition using <a href="http://digress.it" class="text-link">Digress</a> and a
                     text from Project Gutenberg (Schacht 2013).

                     The CommentPress reading interface is divided into three tabbed columns,
                     a central one for the text and a tab on either side for the table of contents and
                     commenting section. In the reading text itself, the pagination of the first
                     edition is replaced by larger groupings of paragraphs on longer scrollable pages,
                     which minimises the necessity to ‘turn pages’ (click forward/back arrows) and
                     makes for a much more effective division of reading sections for reading on a
                     screen. The division claims to be two or more pages per screen from text in the
                     print edition, and in many cases it seems to be closer to four of the original
                     pages. The numbering of paragraphs seems to be concurrent with the first edition
                     although this numeration is not explicitly explained to the user. Comments are
                     arranged in connection to a whole paragraph or in relation to an entire page.
                     Users can also toggle to an ‘Activity’ tab within the ‘Comments’ tab which links
                     in directly to the discussion forums and vice versa. Users who wish to contribute
                     must join a discussion group on the site and comments left are connected to this
                     group. A typical user can join the ‘General Discussion’ group, but there is also a
                     ‘Panel of Experts’ group for selected Thoreau scholars that is openly available
                     for anyone to read. Additionally there are several individual university class
                     groups that are using this site for teaching and learning activities. There does
                     not appear to be any form of moderation of created annotations, although it would
                     be useful to explicitly state this in the project overview. The <a href="http://commonsinabox.org/" class="text-link">Commons In A Box</a> plugin provides a
                     fairly typical and straightforward forum-type interface for online discussion
                     developed at CUNY. The separate groups each have various discussion threads. Users
                     can reply to a thread or ‘favourite’ particular comments. It provides lists of all
                     the other users, access to an activity stream of every action taking place in the
                     website and some basic help information. Another area that needs some
                     clarification is the sustainability of the annotation data: is the data somehow
                     preserved in an XML document or is it just part of the Commons in A Box interface
                     and stored in a database, which has no connection to the text?

                  <h3>A social edition?</h3>
                  
                  <p id="p17"><span class="paracount">17</span>The project is described in the introductory section as a ‘social
                     edition’ which they define as ‘a text that makes room for readers’ comments and
                     conversations’ (Schacht 2014a, <a href="http://commons.digitalthoreau.org/" class="text-link">The Readers' Thoreau</a>). It certainly does utilise social software around
                     a recognised edition of the text but it is perhaps a matter of interpretation and
                     chosen definitions as to what extent it constitutes something you could call a
                     social edition. Equally one could discuss whether it can be accurately described
                     as being ‘scholarly’. Annotation is indeed one of the ‘scholarly primitives’ as
                     described by John Unsworth (Unsworth 2000). Placing this activity in a
                     collaborative, social environment is certainly valuable and effective. Readers
                     using this platform can see commentary added both by known scholars of Thoreau in
                     the Panel of Experts section and by more general users. Discussion between experts
                     and general users in no way diminishes the scholarly quality of the commentary
                     provided but rather has the capacity to enhance it. It also provides various
                     functionalities not possible in a print environment such as searching and the
                     interactivity between the text, the discussion forum and its users. On that basis
                     I believe that Readers’ Thoreau can be classified as a digital scholarly edition
                     even by quite strict definitions. Laying down any kind of definition for a ‘social
                     edition’ is less straightforward as there is little scholarly consensus regarding
                     the relatively new concept. Ray Siemens et al. in their exploration of modelling
                     the social edition laid out five modes of social editing: collaborative
                     annotation, user-derived content, folksonomy tagging, community bibliography, and
                     shared text-analysis (Siemens 2012, 451-452). Readers’ Thoreau provides a space
                     for the first item in this list but none of the others, which is not to say that a
                     social edition should or could address all five of these modes simultaneously.
                     Readers’ Thoreau is primarily a social reading edition of one particular variant
                     of the text. It does not go as far as, say, the <em>Social Edition of the
                        Devonshire Manuscript</em>, which was developed by the Electronic Textual
                     Cultures Laboratory at the University of Victoria as a Wikibook (Siemens et al
                     2014). A Wikibook allows users to edit the text itself, but in the case of
                     Readers’ Thoreau users can only create annotations. The ambition here does not
                     appear to be the creation of a newly edited text but rather to provide a social
                     space in which to engage with that particular text. The edition facilitates
                     interaction among its community of practice. In this domain it is extremely
                     successful, with a highly engaged user community commenting and annotating on a
                     regular basis. To give some sense of quantity, at the time of review there were
                     500 ‘active’ members, of these 40 were active within the last month alone. There
                     were 20 discussion groups with up to 98 members each; the majority of these being
                     private university groups and the open group called ‘General Discussion’ had 76
                     members.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p id="p18"><span class="paracount">18</span>One of the ambitions of the reading edition is to allow for what
                     Thoreau would have described as deliberate reading. In the third chapter of
                     <em>Walden</em> he makes clear his opinions on the act of reading: ‘To read
                     well, that is, to read true books in a true spirit, is a noble exercise, and one
                     that will task the reader more than any exercise which the customs of the day
                     esteem. It requires a training such as the athletes underwent, the steady
                     intention almost of the whole life to this object. Books must be read as
                     deliberately and reservedly as they were written’ (Thoreau in <em>Walden</em>,
                     Schacht 2014a, 3.3). The reading environment certainly creates a space for
                     thoughtful reading in deliberation with other members of the community for further
                     consideration and discussion. If Thoreau's living in the woods was a sort of
                     social experiment then Readers’ Thoreau can also be seen as a social experiment in
                     reading, an experiment which has succeeded in creating an engaged community of
                     readers. It would also be interesting to see if there are any ambitions to
                     integrate these annotations with the fluid text in some way in the future.

                   The third ‘project’ within <em>Digital Thoreau</em> is a student led
                  venture that intends to publish digitally the archival materials left by Walter
                  Harding to tell the story of his life as a scholar, teacher and activist. Harding
                  is
                  described in the overview as arguably the twentieth century’s most important scholar
                  of Thoreau (Schacht 2014a, <a href="http://walterharding.org/">http://walterharding.org/</a>). He was a member of the English Department at
                  SUNY Geneseo and published a number of publications on Thoreau as well as
                  accumulating a very large research collection on the man. Students from SUNY Geneseo
                  built a website which is a digital archive providing access to catalogued images and
                  thematic exhibitions of more than 100 archival items housed at the university library
                  ranging from photographs to correspondence with important figures such as Martin
                  Luther King Jr. The intention is for future students to develop this resource
                  further. It is built as an <a href="http://omeka.org" class="text-link">Omeka</a> site, a
                  web-publishing tool designed specifically for displaying collections and exhibitions.
                  Omeka is a sensible choice as it is open source, user-friendly and is probably the
                  leader in the field of nonproprietary tools for creating online collections and
                  exhibitions. The collection is definitely still a work in progress, which at this
                  point in time does not provide a great deal of added value to <em>Digital
                     Thoreau</em> as a whole. However, as it grows and develops it can potentially
                  provide some useful contextual background on the life of the man who has provided
                  the
                  basis of annotations for the reading edition in this resource and much of the most
                  important Thoreau scholarship ever done. It is also highly commendable both as a
                  pedagogical exercise in teaching students about the interactions between literature
                  and technology and in its dedication to a collaborative community orientated
                  edition.

               <p id="p20"><span class="paracount">20</span>
                  <em>Digital Thoreau</em> with its fluid text edition has succeeded in utilising
                  the tools of the TEI community, XML encoding and the Versioning Machine, and
                  harnessed them to create a resource that is valuable for both scholarly research and
                  pedagogical endeavours. <em>Digital Thoreau</em> as a whole is in fact a
                  testament to the successful implementation of many open source DH tools when
                  considering its usage of CommentPress and Commons in a Box for Readers’ Thoreau and
                  the usage of Omeka for the Walter Harding project and other widely available
                  publishing technologies such as WordPress.
               </p>
               
               <p id="p21"><span class="paracount">21</span>The main aesthetic and practical criticism of <em>Digital
                     Thoreau</em> lies in its slightly fragmented structure and design. Some
                  consistency of design between the three ‘projects’ of <em>Digital Thoreau</em>
                  would make all the offerings of the resource seem more coherent and apparent for the
                  user. Something as simple as a shared header or banner and more consistent routes
                  of
                  navigation between its constituent parts could be an easy and effective enhancement.
                  The main cause of scholarly apprehension stems from the scarcity of detailed
                  editorial information regarding the construction of the edition. These shortcomings
                  can definitely be rectified and the editors have expressed an awareness of these
                  matters and intend to address them as soon as they can.
               </p>
               
               <p id="p22"><span class="paracount">22</span>The combination of the three very different types of project within
                  <em>Digital Thoreau</em> provides the resource with multiple channels of
                  dissemination to relatively diverse audiences. The fluid text provides a valuable
                  resource to textual scholars to trace the genetic writing process of this influential
                  writer. The Walter Harding project has been harnessed as a pedagogical exercise for
                  students at the home institution of the edition and it can potentially contribute
                  some interesting insights into Thoreau scholarship as a whole. The reading edition
                  is
                  significant for the scholarly community, university course students and the wider
                  public by making available a user friendly digital reading edition embedded within
                  a
                  community environment that knits together diverse interested parties. In my personal
                  opinion Readers’ Thoreau is the most exciting component of the overall project and
                  represents a real and original contribution to the field of digital editing and its
                  methods of user engagement and pedagogical experimentation.
               </p>
               
               <p id="p23"><span class="paracount">23</span>The project occupies an entirely new space within Thoreau scholarship.
                  There is a major on-going project to produce a full scholarly edition of his complete
                  works in print form led by the University of California, with 17 volumes of a planned
                  28 now published by Princeton University Press (Witherell 1971-present). In the
                  digital sphere there already exists a project called <em>The Thoreau Reader</em>,
                  which was created by Iowa State University in conjunction with the Thoreau Society
                  (Lenat 2009). This provides annotated editions of his books and essays alongside
                  academic essays and other contextual educational documents but has not been updated
                  since 2009. <em>Digital Thoreau</em> could perhaps benefit from some cooperation
                  with these projects or consider providing some similar contextual materials in its
                  modern digital environment.
               </p>
               
               <p id="p24"><span class="paracount">24</span>
                  <em>Digital Thoreau</em> is continuing to develop and grow and will undoubtedly
                  provide increasing value to Thoreau scholarship. It is also admirable that the
                  <em>Digital Thoreau</em> project as a whole really tries to reflect Thoreau’s
                  own philosophy and the message he attempted to convey in <em>Walden</em>,
                  advocating for simple and deliberate living and indeed for deliberate reading.
