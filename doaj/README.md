# RIDE tei2doaj

The metadata about all the reviews published in RIDE is converted from TEI
to the DOAJ XML format (see https://doaj.org/docs/xml/), so that it can be 
included in the Directory of Open Access Journals. This is done with an XSLT
script, which takes the RIDE TEI files from https://github.com/i-d-e/ride as 
input.
